# Notes API

Express server with a MongoDB database for storing notes.

Deployed API: [`platform-api.amitt.ai`](https://platform-api.amitt.ai)

Deployed FrontEnd: [`platform.amitt.ai`](https://platform.amitt.ai)

## What Worked Well

Express and MongoDB are straightforward to use.

Another student had issues with their api starterpack but the same never occurred for me.

## What Didn't

Nothing.
